# DDR Card Draw

This is web-app that allows random draw of songs from Touhou Spell Bubble
with a variety of optional conditions, primarily around difficulty level. The intended use case is
for competitive tournaments, but it may also be useful as a training tool.

The app will be available at (Site yet to be constructed)
or as a downloadable zip file from the [releases page](https://github.com/ThomasFisher93/THSBCardDraw/releases).
The app is designed such that even the online version will work without any internet connection after
being loaded once in any modern web browser.

Forked from [DDR Card Draw](https://github.com/noahm/DDRCardDraw) (Created by Jeff Lloyd and maintained by [noahm](https://github.com/noahm)
and [FuriousDCSL](https://github.com/FuriousDCSL)).
